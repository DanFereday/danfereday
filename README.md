Hi, I'm Dan!

I have a BS in Cloud and Systems Administration and a MS in Management and Leadership from Western Governor's University. I also hold several industry certificates and have 8 years of experience working in enterprise IT environments.  I am pursuing a career in systems administration, but I also love learning to code.  I have spent time learning how to work in Bash, Python, Powershell, Java, and JavaScript. I have also completed coursework on orchestration tools such as Chef and AWS CloudFormation.

Outside of the office I love hiking, camping, cycling, spending time with my dogs, and playing musical instruments. I also enjoy video games, Stardew Valley is my favorite.

I look forward to sharing my projects with you!
